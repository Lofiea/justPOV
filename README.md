## ⚠️ Note: This repo is a re-upload of a project I built on another GitHub account. I'm in the process of updating the folder structure and copied the original code here for easier access and updates.

## Inspiration:
This project was inspired by the queue system at a nail salon where my mom works. The employees use a paper sign-in sheet to take turns with clients, but during busy hours, it often gets confusing—people forget whose turn it is, and sometimes others try to skip ahead. I wanted to build a simple app that could help organize the queue more clearly, prevent misunderstandings, and make the process a bit more fair.
