## justPOV - Nail Salon Management App
##⚠️ Note: This repo is a re-upload of a project I built on another GitHub account. I'm in the process of updating the folder structure and copied the original code here for easier access and updates.

JustPOV is a mobile app built to help salon staff manage turn-taking and appointments without the confusion of paper logs. It was inspired by the queue system at my mom’s nail salon, where employees rely on handwritten sign-in sheets that often get chaotic—especially during busy hours. People forget whose turn it is, and sometimes others jump ahead, which can feel unfair. JustPOV aims to fix that by offering a clear, digital queue system where staff can sign up by role, track turns, and log activity—all from their phones. Built with React Native and Node.js, it’s a small way to make the process easier.
